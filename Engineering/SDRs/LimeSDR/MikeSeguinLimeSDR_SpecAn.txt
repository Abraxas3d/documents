-58.36 - 10LOGBW = -88.36 dBc/Hz
If I read the LMS7002M Spec sheet right, it should be down around -96 dBc/Hz? Attached pdf.

-49 - 10LOGBW = -79 dBc/Hz spec around -87 dBc/Hz?

A broader view - need to go digging deeper.

small spur on the low side?

Output power varies. I've seen upwards of +15 dBm. I am powering the LimeSDR board off an external supply.

I'm using LimeSuite to set up the transmit output on TX1-1. There are so many settings it's possible/probable I'm missing something.

I also have done rudimentary NF measurements. Paul, W1GHZ loaned me a homebrew noise head he had built from his QEX article in 1996? on Noise Figure. I used it to measure the NF, but had to rely on a chart for ENR. So assumptions!!!  I found I definitely had to use a preamp in front of the Lime. I used an AD6IW wideband pre for testing.

I need to do more real world tests on the bands....
