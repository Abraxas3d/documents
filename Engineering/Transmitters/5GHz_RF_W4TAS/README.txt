I have purchased several of the 5.8 GHz amplifiers from china. 
I have used combiners to get about 8 watts from two of them and used another as a driver. 
I used a pipe cape filter between the driver and final.
With this configuration, zero dbm input will give full output with a few mods to the amplifiers. 
The SMAs are SMA-r so I changed all of them to standard SMA female. 
There is a built in 6 db attenuator on the input to accommodate the one watt video transmitter 
on drones. I jumped that out. 
The amplifiers are linear and work fine. 
I paid 29 bucks each for my amplifiers and about 30 bucks each for 2 for combiners. 
A great deal for a linear 8 watt amplifier for 6 cm.
