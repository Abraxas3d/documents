We reached out to AMSAT-DL about the Phase 4A payload, and whether or not we can support their downlink with our Phase 4 Ground project. The contact was positive and more discussion will occur. Here's a technical brief about Es'hail Phase 4A project. This payload will not be visible from North America. If successful, a payload further east, visible from Japan, will possibly be launched. 

Supporting these payloads increases our market and opportunity for technical collaboration with amateurs around the world.

Wideband digital transponder
 2401.500 -  2409.500 MHz Uplink
10491.000 - 10499.000 MHz Downlink

Equipment requirements:

X-Band 10 GHz Downlink:
– 89 cm dishes in rainy areas at EOC like Brazil or Thailand
– 60 cm around coverage peak
– 75 cm dishes at peak -2dB
– NB: linear vertical polarisation
– WB: linear horizontal polarisation

S-Band 2.4 GHz NB-Uplink:
– narrow band modes like SSB, CW
– 5W nominal Uplink power (22.5 dBi antenna gain, 75cm dish)
– RHCP polarisation

S-Band 2.4 GHz WB-Uplink (DATV):
– wide band modes, DVB-S2
– peak EIRP of 53 dBW (2.4m dish and 100W) required
– RHCP polarisation

As you can see from the technical brief above (in the notes), the uplink frequency is 2.4GHz, not 5GHz. 4A uses a commercial DVB-S downlink. 4B uses DVB-S2X. S2X is backwards compatible with DVB-S. 

4B uses generic stream encapsulation. 4A uses 1 mpeg transport stream. The questions I have are whether or not our radio will "just work" with 4A. This is exciting stuff.

If you follow the links in the 4A notes above, then you can review a list of suggested hardware. These suggestions also work for us.
