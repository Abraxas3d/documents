This is the Phase 4 Ground weekly report for the week ending September 11th 2016.

Some of us are going to be at GNU Radio Conference all of next week and TAPR DCC next weekend. If you're there, please feel free to post whatever seems relevant and interesting to Phase 4 on the gnu_radio_con_2016 channel in Slack. That's my plan. I will do my best to summarize at the end of the day on the email list in a single post. 

First up: LimeSDR unboxing and call for developers. 

There's SiLabs EVM progress.

There's Mr. Brain's DVB-S2X demodulator coding progress.

There's 10GHz PA possibilities that I need help reviewing and deciding about. 

I'm looking for updates on the 5GHz RF chain? Schematic and BOM? 

I'm looking for people that are standing around waiting to do something? Let me know!
