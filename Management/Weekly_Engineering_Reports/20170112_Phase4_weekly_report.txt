AMSAT Phase 4 Ground home page https://phase4ground.github.io/

We are Phase 4 Ground and our mission is to implement an open source version of the DVB-S2 and DVB-S2X and Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) protocols for amateur radio, for both space and ground. The project includes the radios and a central server, or Groundsat. It's named Groundsat because it's a satellite simulator on the ground, providing the same functions a broadband microwave payload would in order to create a network. 

All the Digital Video Broadcasting protocols that we are working with can be found for free at https://www.dvb.org/ and from links on our homepage.

Note that GSE allows any digital data to be transmitted. We are not implementing a system limited to MPEG video. 

DVB world conference is coming up! Anyone near Warsaw? That's where it's at for 2018.

Our reference design is in GNU Radio and we have some of the blocks done. We need plenty more and upcoming videos will go into detail for each one.

Engineering for Phase 4 Ground is done primarily on our email list and Slack accounts. 

We have a YouTube playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavdGnjBLuiX97DAKk32NJ1bCF1a0cv01 that includes our video reports and videos that are of use or interest to Phase 4 Ground. Please subscribe and let us know what you'd like to hear about most. 





Phase 4 Space home page https://phase4space.github.io/

Phase 4 Space is an open source public domain project for broadband microwave amateur radio satellites because we want a lot of payloads to talk to! We'll be using two wonderful open source resources to start. AO-10 blueprints and UPSat, the open source satellite currently operational, from Libre Space Foundation. 

To volunteer directly for either, visit the AMSAT volunteer landing page https://www.amsat.org/volunteer-for-amsat/ or send an email w5nyv@arrl.net to get started!
