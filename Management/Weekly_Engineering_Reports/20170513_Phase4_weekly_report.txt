 Hi all,
just a reminder that our SDMG meeting has been moved up a week to this Monday, May 8.
7:00 at my home in La Mesa. I plan to demo the True Position GPS 10 MHz reference with Arduino and display. A very nice system for the money. More of those GPS boards are still available. Michelle will be brnging SDR related show & tell and Brian may bring his operational loop antenna.
