Remote operation is one of the most talked about and most requested feature in amateur radio. 

Remote operations enables performance improvements (one can put the radio closer to the antenna and put the antenna in the best possible location), more comfortable and flexible operating positions (operate from your iPad by the pool), and dramatically increased coverage areas (remote stations can be located where they increase communications coverage and therefore provide more public service). 

Remote operations are a great way to learn about radio, networking, reliability, and protocols. They are a big educational win. The problem is easily defined and arguably the performance can be easily measured, but there is plenty to be done to improve the current state of the art in remote operations.

We want to define a framework for remote operations that doesn't reinvent the wheel but also doesn't hold us back from the radio working very well as a remote station. 

Linux has several time-tested tools and applications. There are some proprietary solutions. There's a lot of DIY here. A lot of you have experience setting up remote operations. 

Here's where we want to start.

What works? What is solvable? What is currently not solvable? 

What should necessarily be included in Phase 4 Ground radios? 

Steve Conklin is our linux platform lead and is very interested in getting this right. Please help him with your feedback and input.
