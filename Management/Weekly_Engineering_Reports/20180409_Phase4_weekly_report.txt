2 4 6 8 Everybody Correlate!

Correlator team had a conference call on Thursday 5 April 2018. Jordan, Brennan, Ed, and I talked on the conference bridge Ed set up for us for about 45 minutes. We covered a lot of ground and got some idea of next steps. We have a repository that has GNU Radio draft blocks that do the Pi/2 BPSK demodulation and decoding, and we need to get it working as a correlator.

We also have a correlation estimation block in GNU Radio that has an issue. 

Brennan Ashton reviewed our block and didn't see any major issues yet, and then went out to see what he could see about the correlation estimation block.

Please review Brennan's pull request here:
https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/pull/1725

This is an attempt to solve this issue here:
https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/1207

Which if successful will help us and a lot of other people. 

This effort is in progress and will be updated as the code is reviewed and feedback from GNU Radio given.

10GHz Filter

We have a 10GHz filter design proposed from Northern California.

It covers the 10GHz amateur band, has 0.1dB variation over the band, 0.1dB insertion loss, and 20-30dB return loss. It's a high-performance filter and we are talking about how to get it published, how many prototypes to build, and what the potential market might be.
