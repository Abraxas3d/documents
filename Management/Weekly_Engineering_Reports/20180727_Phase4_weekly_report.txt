Ubuntu Snaps for SDR

Snaps are containerized software packages for Ubuntu. They are designed to be simple to create, install, run, and update on all major Linux systems without modification. 

Steve Conklin, our platform lead, believes that Ubuntu Snaps are a great solution for some of our SDR work. He will be looking to work with Phil Karn's SDR package. What needs to happen next is getting the Karn SDR package updated with any recent work, and getting it to reliably build. If you can help with this, then contact Steve Conklin (steve@conklinhouse.com) and proceed.
