Code of Conduct reminder and free eBook

There is a code of conduct enforcement book available now for free. It's called “How to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports" and is written by Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner and edited by Annalee Flower Horne. 

This guide includes:
Basic code of conduct theory
How to prepare to enforce a code of conduct
Step-by-step instructions on how to respond to a report
In-depth discussion of relevant topics
Dozens of real-world examples of responding to reports

Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner were the lead authors of the Ada Initiative anti­-harassment policy, which is the basis of thousands of codes of conduct in use today. Valerie has more than 7 years of professional experience writing and implementing codes of conduct for software-related companies, venture capital firms, and non-profits.

The book is available under the Creative Commons BY-SA license, allowing free reuse and modification of the materials as long as you credit the authors. It can be downloaded from https://files.frameshiftconsulting.com/books/

Phase 4 Ground uses the code of conduct from Open Research Institute. The participant policies and code of conduct can be found at https://openresearch.institute/developer-and-participant-policies/

If you are volunteering with an organization in amateur radio (or elsewhere) that does not have a code of conduct, and you've never had a problem, then great for you! But, if you do have a problem, and the organization lacks any sort of policy, then it can be a serious and damaging experience.

Volunteer time and energy is extremely valuable. Our policies are written and enforced in order to dramatically reduce the occurrence of things like favoritism, high turnover, illegal or abusive behavior, bullying, and theft. 

What we do (digital wireless communications) is difficult but it's also supposed to be safe and fun to participate. You should know what you're signing up for when you want to work with us. 

There are a lot of transformations, some controversial, currently going on in multiple large and well-known open source projects. The transformations seem to be about how to establish a culture that improves performance and is also welcoming outside a narrow demographic swath. Given that context, it is necessary to be transparent and firm about our goals and what we expect. 

Direct feedback and questions about the code and policies is welcome and encouraged. Their existence is not up for debate. This is due to the extremely negative experiences all ORI board members (and many Phase 4 Ground volunteers) have had with organizations that lack rules or are lead by people that refuse to adopt them.

Donated Dish Update and Yes There are More Dishes

Doug Phelps will need some help with distributing the "smaller" dishes. He has everyone's names still, is putting up with my nagging about it, and has promised to give an update. 

But in addition to that, he has rescued a set of 6 foot aluminum dishes with feeds, mounting hardware, and radomes. These are safe at his friend's farm, so he's motivated to get them moving! 

There are four available and here are the details:

HEO and GEO Launches

I don't like keeping secrets. However, we do have some secrets. 

The Phase 4B payload, and the other related projects that we have actively supported (like CQC) all require launches. We have been been working very hard to get more launches. 

Yes, we have one with Wide Field of View payload with the Air Force. The good news is how well we did in getting engineering approval for this launch. The technical and management competence, and the quality of the design, all spoke for themselves. Unfortunately, the current integrator has decided to ask for a lot more money and guarentee a lot less mission time for that money. 

This means it's not a good deal for GEO coverage for US hams. 

Fortunately there's been a lot going on behind the scenes. This work dates back before the satellite integrator change, and before the disappointing news about the cost. 

I can't share the details. I wish I could. I can say that our prospects have never been better. Anyone following along and helping the project, anyone that has been with us through a lot of challenging experiences, deserves to know that we are absolutely serious, focused, and unrelenting in obtaining multiple launches for this technology.

Traditionally, an amateur launch would be announced and then a payload developed. With modern digital technologies taking significantly longer development time than legacy technologies, and with opportunistic short-notice launches becoming more the norm, this design pattern really can't work for us. That's one of the reasons we need to work hard, now, as if the launch was imminent. Howie DeFelice and I wrote an article for QEX about this. 

Working hard without a launch date is a lot to ask of people that are not getting paid and in some cases not being given the support or recognition they should be getting.

In the new year, we'll be doing just that and asking for more in terms of technology demonstration and development from the team. The next big technology demonstration will be HamCation, and the most ambitious goal for that is to have LDPC working on an FPGA with interactive controls. This is the heart of the coding part of the receiver. 

A GNU Radio LDPC demonstration can be seen in a recent video report, and the GPU version can be run by anyone with a late model Nvidia GPU. 

Until HamCation, my goal is to get the air interface into the best possible shape. We need to capture the excellent progress we've made and make it as easy as possible for upcoming payloads to say "Yes!" to Phase 4 Ground. 

There's plenty going on. Progress is good. Launch prospects are part of that good news. A lot of the work is invisible during the negotiating process, but we are working as hard as we can to make it more than worth the wait.  

More soon! Happy Holidays :+)

Thanks to the enormous generosity of MyriadRF, we have some hardware help!

Five LimeSDR Mini Kits have been given to Phase 4 Ground for satellite communications development work. 

We want to get these into as many hardworking hands as possible! Write me today with your need and let's get you up and running. 

I recently set up a LimeSDR Mini with GNU Radio with one of our list members and it went very well. This is a wonderful SDR. The LimeSuite GUI allows prototyping with what feels like every register setting on the controller. Performance is very good. 

For a talk about LimeSDR (and the extended frequency range chip) from Microwave Update 2018 from Mike Seguin N1JEZ, please see https://youtu.be/F76BzezuCmw

LDPC-BCH decode on the FPGA is of course an area of great interest for us. LDPC is the forward error correction for DVB-S2/X. But, we are also interested in doing more with Polar codes. There is at least one open source satellite payload project that has specified Polar forward error correcting codes. There is very little open source work here, it's cutting edge, and is specified for use in 5G communications. Polar codes are the first family of error-correcting codes that achieve the Shannon capacity for a wide range of communication channels with efficient encoding and decoding. 

The FPGA on the LimeSDR mini is the Intel MAX 10 (10M16SAU169C8G 169-UBGA). How far can we take it? 

What else needs doing? How about a SatNOGS station with the LimeSDR mini? A proof of concept of Phase 4 Ground authentication and authorization scheme? Handling the Generic Stream Encapsulation streams properly from the downlink? Plenty to do! Dive in and we will help you.
