EFR32MG1P233F256GM48-C0 <- lookitup :)


[10:44] 
covers exactly the 902-930 MHz band


[10:44] 
20.3 dBm output


[10:46] 
(ham bonus: covers the 70cm band just as well)


[10:47] 
but comes with a boring, because easy to code for, ARM Cortex-M4


[10:48] 
what disappoints is that it doesn't have USB or QSPI or anything fast to connect to the outside world
